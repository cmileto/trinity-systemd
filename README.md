# trinity-systemd

## Installation
* Move these files into /etc/systemd/system.
* Create a `trinity` user. 
* Modify any paths that need to be changed for your build paths.

## Notes
* Make sure you have SOAP or RA enabled as you will not be able to access the server via direct console if it's running as a service.
* This is very much still in don't-use-this-because-it's-not-prod-ready-yet state. Haven't even put it on my own server yet.
